(LLL) : Low-Level-Lush with Lisp.  Low-Level-Lush was a combination of Lush2.0.1 and LLVM2.8, in order to bring out the best in both.

And then, because I really needed threaded garbage collection, I added Clozure Common Lisp. (SBCL could also work here) And so Low-Level-Lush-with-Lisp was born, abbreviated (LLL) -- the Lisp is in the parenthesis, of course!

Lush2.0.1 offers excellent programming environment for numerics, machine learning, plotting, GUI, an excellent class system and lovely interface to C code and producing C code for deployment.

Unfortunately Lush2.0.1 lacks the ability to construct closures. 

LLVM2.8 with the Clang C++ compiler offers the ability to codgen C/C++ fragments and execute them in a JIT interpretted environment.

Together they offer a great interactive and production environment. And, as above, Clozure adds threaded garbage collection.  Since all three are LGPL or LLGPL, this actually works.


INSTALL, example:

mkdir install
cd llvm-2.8
./configure --prefix=`cd ..; pwd`/install --enable-optimized --disable-expensive-checks --enable-jit --enable-pic --enable-shared --enable-targets=x86_64 REQUIRES_RTTI=1
make install

cd lush2.0.1
./configure --prefix=`cd ..; pwd`/install
make install
