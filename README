LLL : Low-Level-Lush is a combination of Lush2.0.1 and LLVM2.9, in order to bring out the best in both.

Lush2.0.1 offers excellent programming environment for numerics, machine learning, plotting, GUI, an excellent class system and lovely interface to C code and producing C code for deployment.

Unfortunately Lush2.0.1 lacks the ability to construct closures. 

LLVM2.8 with the Clang C++ compiler offers the ability to codgen C/C++ fragments and execute them in a JIT interpretted environment.

Together they offer a great interactive and production environment.
