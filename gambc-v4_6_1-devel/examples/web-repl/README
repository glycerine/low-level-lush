This example is a Java application that provides a user-interface to
the Gambit interpreter's read-eval-print loop.  The application is
composed of two programs: web-repl.scm and Repl.java.  To try out this
example you must start the execution of web-repl.scm.  For instance

  % gsi web-repl &

This starts a ``REPL server'' on port 7000.  The program Repl.java is
a client that connects to this server to start a new REPL. Repl.java
can be run standalone, for instance

  % javac Repl.java
  % java Repl

or as an applet (just visit the file index.html with a Java enabled
browser).
