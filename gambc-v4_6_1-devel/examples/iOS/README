This program implements the "Gambit REPL" application for iOS devices.
It is a simple development environment for Scheme.  The user can
interact with a REPL, and edit/save/run small scripts.

This example was tested with iOS 4.3 and XCode 4.0 .  If you do not have
these versions, some adjustments will be needed at the top of the
build-gambit-iOS shell script, and possibly other places.
