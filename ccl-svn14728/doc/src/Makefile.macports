# Use xsltproc and an XSL stylesheet to translate DocBook XML to HTML

XSLTPROC = xsltproc


# On a new system or when using a new version of xsltproc or of the
# stylesheet packages, it's a good idea to run with --load-trace and
# peruse the output to  make sure that none of the stylesheets are being
# pulled over the network.  It's a significant expense, compounded by
# the fact that they aren't cached across invocations of xsltproc.  If they
# are, you should make sure that the correct catalog file is being used
# (see below), and, if so, that its contents are correct.
#EXTRAPARAMS= --load-trace
EXTRAPARAMS= --xinclude --nonet

# The catalog file tells the translator where to find XSL stylesheets on the
# local system.  The first choice here is what should be used for builds
# which are going to take place on the clozure.com server.  The second is
# for when you have installed docbook on OS X using the fink package manager.
# If neither applies, comment both out, and the translator will automagically
# look on the web for the stylesheets, instead.
