  <!-- ================================================================ -->
  <sect1 id="ccl-ide-introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
    
    <para>&CCL; ships with the complete source code for an integrated
    development environment written using Cocoa on Mac OS X. This
    chapter describes how to build and use that environment,
    referred to hereafter simply as "the IDE".</para>

    <para>The IDE provides a programmable text editor, listener
      windows, an inspector for Lisp data structures, and a means of
      easily building a Cocoa application in Lisp. In addition, its
      source code provides an example of a fairly complex Cocoa
      application written in Lisp.</para>

    <para>The current version of the IDE has seen the addition of numerous
    features and many bugfixes. Although it's by no means a finished product,
    we hope it will prove more useful than previous versions, and we
    plan additional work on the IDE for future releases.</para>

  <sect1 id="running-ccl-ide"><title>Running the IDE</title>
    
    <para>After it has been built, you can run the "Clozure CL.app"
      application normally, by double-clicking its icon. When
      launched, the IDE initially displays a
      single <glossterm linkend="listener_window">listener
        window</glossterm> that you can use to interact with Lisp. You
      can type Lisp expressions for evaluation at the prompt in the
      listener window. You can also
      use <glossterm linkend="hemlock">Hemlock</glossterm> editing
      commands to edit the text of expressions in the listener
      window.</para>

    <title>IDE Features</title>

    <sect2 id="ide-editor-windows">
      <title>Editor Windows</title>
      <para>You can open an editor window either by choosing Open from
        the File menu and then selecting a text file, or by choosing
        New from the File menu. You can also evaluate the
        expression <code>(ed)</code> in the listener window; in that
        case &CCL; creates a new window as if you had chosen New from
        the File menu.</para>

      <para>Editor windows
        implement <glossterm linkend="hemlock">Hemlock</glossterm>
        editing commands. You can use all the editing and customization
        features of Hemlock within any editor window (including listener
        windows).</para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2 id="ide-lisp-menu">
      <title>The Lisp Menu</title>
      <para>The Lisp menu provides several commands for interacting
        with the running Lisp session, in addition to the ways you can
        interact with it by evaluating expressions. You can evaluate a
        selected range of text in any editing buffer. You can compile
        and load the contents of editor windows (please note that in the
        current version, &CCL; compiles and loads the contents of the
        file associated with an editor window; that means that if you
        try to load or compile a window that has not been saved to a
        file, the result is an error).</para>

      <para>You can interrupt computations, trigger breaks, and select
        restarts from the Lisp menu. You can also display a backtrace or
        open the <link linkend="section_inspector_window">Inspector
          window</link>.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Checking for Updates</title>
        <para>At the bottom of the Lisp menu is an item entitled
        "Check for Updates". If your copy of &CCL; came from the
        Clozure Subversion server (which is the preferred source), and
        if your internet connection is working, then you can select
        this menu item to check for updates to your copy of
        &CCL;.</para>

        <para>When you select "Check for Updates", &CCL; uses the svn
        program to query the Clozure Subversion repository and
        determine whether new updates to &CCL; are available. (This
        means that on Mac OS X versions earlier than 10.5, you must
        ensure that the Subversion client software is installed before
        using the "Check for Updates" feature. See
        the <ulink url="http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Subversion-on-Mac-OS-X">wikiHow
        page</ulink> on installing Subversion for more information.)
        If updates are available, &CCL; automatically downloads and
        installs them. After a successful download, &CCL; rebuilds
        itself, and then rebuilds the IDE on the newly-rebuilt
        Lisp. Once this process is finished, you should quit the
        running IDE and start the newly built one (which will be in
        the same place that the old one was).</para>

        <para>Normally, &CCL; can install updates and rebuild itself
        without any problems. Occasionally, an unforeseen problem
        (such as a network outage, or a hardware failure) might
        interrupt the self-rebuilding process, and leave your copy of
        &CCL; unusable. If you are expecting to update your copy of
        &CCL; frequently, it might be prudent to keep a backup copy of
        your working environment ready in case of such
        situtations. You can also always obtain a full, fresh copy of
        &CCL; from Clozure's repository..</para>

    <sect2 id="ide-tools-menu">
      <title>The Tools Menu</title>
      <para>The tools menu provides access to the Apropos and
        Processes windows. The Apropos window searches the running Lisp
        image for symbols that match any text you enter. You can use the
        Apropos window to quickly find function names and other useful
        symbols. The Processes window lists all threads running in the
        current Lisp session. If you double-click a process entry, &CCL;
        opens an <link linkend="section_inspector_window">Inspector
          window</link> on that process.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="ide-inspector-window">
      <title>The Inspector Window</title>
      <anchor id="section_inspector_window"/>
      <para>The Inspector window displays information about a Lisp
        value. The information displayed varies from the very simple, in
        the case of a simple data value such as a character, to the
        complex, in the case of structured data such as lists or CLOS
        objects. The left-hand column of the window's display shows the
        names of the object's attributes; the righthand column shows the
        values associated with those attributes. You can inspect the
        values in the righthand column by double-clicking them.</para>

      <para>Inspecting a value in the righthand column changes the
        Inspector window to display the double-clicked object. You can
        quickly navigate the fields of structured data this way,
        inspecting objects and the objects that they refer
        to. Navigation buttons at the top left of the window enable you
        to retrace your steps, backing up to return to previously-viewed
        objects, and going forward again to objects you navigated into
        previously.</para>

      <para>You can change the contents of a structured object by
        evaluating expressions in a listener window. The refresh button
        (marked with a curved arrow) updates the display of the
        Inspector window, enabling you to quickly see the results of
        changing a data structure.</para>

  <!-- ================================================================ -->
  <sect1 id="ide-source-code"><title>IDE Sources</title>
    
    <para>&CCL; builds the IDE from sources in the "objc-bridge" and
      "cocoa-ide" directories in the &CCL; distribution. The IDE as a
      whole is a relatively complicated application, and is probably not
      the best place to look when you are first trying to understand how
      to build Cocoa applications. For that, you might benefit more from
      the examples in the "examples/cocoa/" directory. Once you are
      familiar with those examples, though, and have some experience
      building your own application features using Cocoa and the
      Objective-C bridge, you might browse through the IDE sources to
      see how it implements its features.</para>

    <para>The search path for &CCL;'s <code>REQUIRE</code> feature
      includes the "objc-bridge" and "cocoa-ide" directories. You can
      load features defined in these directories by
      using <code>REQUIRE</code>. For example, if you want to use the
      Cocoa features of &CCL; from a terminal session (or from an Emacs
      session using SLIME or ILISP), you can evaluate <code>(require
        :cocoa)</code>.</para>
  </sect1>

  <!-- ================================================================ -->
  <sect1 id="application-builder"><title>The Application Builder</title>
    <anchor id="application_builder"/>
    <para>One important feature of the IDE currently has no Cocoa user
      interface: the application builder. The application builder
      constructs a
      Cocoa <glossterm linkend="application_bundle">application
        bundle</glossterm> that runs a Lisp image when double-clicked. You
      can use the application builder to create Cocoa applications in
      Lisp. These applications are exactly like Cocoa applications
      created with XCode and Objective-C, except that they are written
      in Lisp.</para>

    <para>To make the application builder available, evaluate the
      expression <code>(require :build-application)</code>. &CCL; loads
      the required subsystems, if necessary.</para>

    <para>
      The <varname>build-application</varname> function constructs an
      application bundle, populates it with the files needed to satisfy
      Mac OS X that the bundle is a launchable application, and saves an
      executable Lisp image to the proper subdirectory of the
      bundle. Assuming that the saved Lisp image contains correct code,
      a user can subsequently launch the resulting Cocoa application by
      double-clicking its icon in the Finder, and the saved Lisp
      environment runs.

            application bundle. This option is often useful when you
            are developing a new application, because it enables your
            built application to have a fully-functional user
            interface even before you have finished designing one. By
            default, the application uses the application menu and
            other UI elements of the IDE until you specify
            otherwise. Once your application's UI is fully

    <para><code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code> creates a folder named

      directory <replaceable>directory</replaceable>. Inside that
      folder, it creates the "Contents" folder that Mac OS X
      application bundles are expected to contain, and populates it
      with the "MacOS" and "Resources" folders, and the "Info.plist"
      and "PkgInfo" files that must be present in a working
      application bundle. It takes the contents of the "Info.plist"
      and "PkgInfo" files from the parameters
      to <code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code>. If <replaceable>copy-ide-resources</replaceable>
      is true then it copies the contents of the "Resources" folder
      from the "Resources" folder of the running IDE.</para>

    <para>The work needed to produce a running Cocoa application is
    very minimal. In fact, if you
    supply <code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code> with a valid nibfile and
    pathnames, it builds a running Cocoa application that displays
    your UI. It doesn't need you to write any code at all to do
    this. Of course, the resulting application doesn't do anything
    apart from displaying the UI defined in the nibfile. If you want
    your UI to accomplish anything, you need to write the code to
    handle its events. But the path to a running application with your
    UI in it is very short indeed.</para>

   <para>Please note that <code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code> is a work in
    progress. It can easily build a working Cocoa application, but it
    still has limitations that may in some cases prove
    inconvenient. For example, in the current version it provides no
    easy way to specify an application delegate different from the
    default. If you find the current limitations
    of <code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code> too restrictive, and want to try
    extending it for your use, you can find the source code for it in
    "ccl/cocoa-ide/build-application.lisp". You can see the default
    values used to populate the "Info.plist" file in
    "ccl/cocoa-ide/builder-utilities.lisp".</para>

    use <code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code>, see the Currency Converter

      <para>You can use the same method to automate building your
      Lisp/Cocoa applications. &CCL; handles each Lisp expressions
      passed with a <literal>-e</literal> argument in order, so you
      can simply evaluate a sequence of Lisp expressions as in the
      above example to build your application, ending with a call
      to <literal>CCL:BUILD-APPLICATION</literal>. The call
      to <literal>CCL:BUILD-APPLICATION</literal> can process all the
      same arguments as if you evaluated it in a Listener window in
      the &CCL; IDE.</para>

      <para>Building a substantial Cocoa application (rather than just
      reproducing the Lisp environment using defaults, as is done in
      the above example) is likely to involve a relatively complicated
      sequence of loading source files and perhaps evaluating Lisp
      forms. You might be best served to place your command line in a
      shell script that you can more easily edit and test.</para>

      <para>One potentially complicated issue concerns loading all
        your Lisp source files in the right order. You might consider
        using ASDF to define and load a system that includes all the
        parts of your application before
        calling <literal>CCL:BUILD-APPLICATION</literal>. ASDF is a
        "another system-definition facility", a sort
        of <literal>make</literal> for Lisp, and is included in the
        &CCL; distribution. You can read more about ASDF at the ASDF
        <ulink url="http://constantly.at/lisp/asdf/">home
        page</ulink>.</para>

      <para>Alternatively, you could use the standard features of
        Common Lisp to load your application's files in the proper
        order.</para>
