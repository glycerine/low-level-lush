<chapter id="building-ccl-from-source"><title>Building &CCL; from its Source Code</title>
  <anchor id="Building-CCL"/>
  <para>&CCL;, like many other Lisp implementations, consists of a
    kernel and a heap image.  The kernel is an ordinary C program, and
    is built with a C compiler.  It provides very basic and
    fundamental facilities, such as memory management, garbage
    collection, and bootstrapping.  All the higher-level features are
    written in Lisp, and compiled into the heap image.  Both parts are
    needed to have a working Lisp implementation; neither the kernel
    nor the heap image can stand alone.</para>

  <para>You may already know that, when you have a C compiler which
    is written in C, you need a working C compiler to build the
    compiler. Similarly, the &CCL; heap image includes a Lisp
    compiler, which is written in Lisp. You therefore need a working
    Lisp compiler in order to build the Lisp heap image.</para>
  
  <para>Where will you get a working Lisp compiler?  No worries; you
    can use a precompiled copy of a (slightly older and compatible)
    version of &CCL;. This section explains how to do all this.</para>

  <para>In principle it should be possible to use another
    implementation of Common Lisp as the host compiler, rather than an
    older &CCL;; this would be a challenging and experimental way to
    build, and is not described here.</para>

      may be helpful to refer to these definitions.</para>

        files</glossterm> are the object files produced

      machine code associated with function definitions and the
      external representation of other lisp objects in a compact,
      machine-readable form. fasl is short for
      &ldquo;<literal>FAS</literal>t
      <literal>L</literal>oading&rdquo;. &CCL; uses different pathname
      types (extensions) to name fasl files on different platforms;
      see
      <xref linkend="Platform-specific-filename-conventions"/> </para>

    <para>The <indexterm><primary>lisp
          kernel</primary></indexterm> <glossterm linkend="lisp_kernel">Lisp
        kernel</glossterm> is a C program with a fair amount of
      platform-specific assembly language code. Its basic job is to
      map a lisp heap image into memory, transfer control to some
      compiled lisp code that the image contains, handle any
      exceptions that occur during the execution of that lisp code,
      and provide various other forms of runtime support for that
      code. &CCL; uses different filenames to name the lisp kernel
      files on different platforms; see
      <xref linkend="Platform-specific-filename-conventions"/>.</para>

    <para>A <indexterm><primary>heap
          image</primary></indexterm> <glossterm linkend="lisp_image">heap
        image</glossterm> is a file that can be quickly mapped into a
      process's address space. Conceptually, it's not too different
      from an executable file or shared library in the OS's native
      format (ELF or Mach-O/dyld format); for historical reasons,
      &CCL;'s own heap images are in their own (fairly simple)
      format. The term <literal>full heap image</literal> refers to a
      heap image file that contains all of the code and data that
      comprise &CCL;. &CCL; uses different filenames to name the
      standard full heap image files on different platforms; see
      <xref linkend="Platform-specific-filename-conventions"/>.</para>

    <para>A <indexterm><primary>bootstrapping
          image</primary></indexterm> bootstrapping image is a minimal
      heap image used in the process of building &CCL; itself.  The
      bootstrapping image contains just enough code to load the rest
      of &CCL; from fasl files.  It may help to think of the
      bootstrapping image as the egg and the full heap image as the
      chicken. &CCL; uses different filenames to name the standard
      bootstrapping image files on different platforms; see
      <xref linkend="Platform-specific-filename-conventions"/>

    <para>Each supported platform (and possibly a few
      as-yet-unsupported ones) has a uniquely named subdirectory of
      <literal>ccl/lisp-kernel/</literal>; each such
      <indexterm><primary>kernel build directory</primary></indexterm>
      contains a Makefile and may contain some auxiliary files (linker
      scripts, etc.) that are used to build the lisp kernel on a
      particular platform.The platform-specific name of the kernel
      build directory is described in
      <xref linkend="Platform-specific-filename-conventions"/>.</para>

    <title>Building the kernel</title>
    <para>The Lisp kernel is the executable that you run to use
      Lisp.  It doesn't actually contain the entire Lisp
      implementation; rather, it loads a heap image which contains the
      specifics&mdash;the "library", as it might be called if this was a C
      program.  The kernel also provides runtime support to the heap
      image, such as garbage collection, memory allocation, exception
      handling, and the OS interface.</para>

    <para>The Lisp kernel file has different names on different
      platforms. See
      <xref linkend="Platform-specific-filename-conventions"/>. On all
      platforms the lisp kernel sources reside
      in <literal>ccl/lisp-kernel</literal>.</para>

    <para>This section gives directions on how to rebuild the Lisp
      kernel from its source code.  Most &CCL; users will rarely
      have to do this.  You probably will only need to do it if you are
      attempting to port &CCL; to a new architecture or extend or enhance
      its kernel in some way.  As mentioned above, this step happens
      automatically when you do
      <programlisting>
? (rebuild-ccl :full t)
      </programlisting>
    </para>

	  </itemizedlist>
	  <para> In general, the more recent the versions of those
	    tools, the better; some versions of gcc 3.x on Linux have
	    difficulty compiling some of the kernel source code correctly
	    (so gcc 4.0 should be used, if possible.)  On Mac OS X, the
	    versions of the tools distributed with Xcode should work fine;
	    on Linux, the versions of the tools installed with the OS (or
	    available through its package management system) should work
	    fine if they're "recent enough".  On FreeBSD, the installed
	    version of the <literal>m4</literal> program doesn't support
	    some features that the kernel build process depends on; the
	    GNU version of the m4 macroprocessor (called
	    <literal>gm4</literal> on FreeBSD) should be installed.
	  </para>

      run Lisp code until we have a working Lisp implementation, and
      we can't make our Lisp implementation work until we can run Lisp
      code.  Since the heap image already contains a fully-working
      implementation, all we need to do is load it into memory and
      start using it.</para>
    <para>If you're building a new version of &CCL;, you need to
      build a new heap image.</para>
    <para>(You might also wish to build a heap image if you have a
      large program that is very complicated or time-consuming to
      load, so that you will be able to load it once, save an image,
      and thenceforth never have to load it again. At any time, a heap
      image capturing the entire memory state of a running Lisp can be
      created by calling the function
      <literal>ccl:save-application</literal>.)</para>

	  <para>When you invoke &CCL; with the bootstrapping image, it
	    starts up, loads all of the &CCL; fasl files, and saves out a

      <para>A few points worth noting:</para>
	  <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	      <para>There's a circular dependency between the full heap
	        image and the bootstrapping image, in that each is used to
	        build the other.</para>
	    </listitem>
        <listitem>
	      <para>There are some minor implementation
	        differences, but the environment in effect after the
	        bootstrapping image has loaded its fasl files is essentially
	        equivalent to the environment provided by the full heap
	        image; the latter loads a lot faster and is easier to
	        distribute, of course.</para>
	    </listitem>
        <listitem>
	      <para>If the full heap image doesn't work (because
	        of an OS compatibilty problem or other bug), it's very likely
	        that the bootstrapping image will suffer the same
	        problems.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
      <para>Given a bootstrapping image and a set of up-to-date fasl
        files, the development cycle usually involves editing lisp
        sources (or updating those sources via cvs update),
        recompiling modified files, and using the bootstrapping image
        to produce a new heap image.</para>

      <title>Generating a bootstrapping image</title>
      <para>The bootstrapping image isn't provided in &CCL;
        distributions. It can be built from the source code provided
        in distributions (using a lisp image and kernel provided in
        those distributions) using the procedure described
        below.</para>

      <para>The bootstrapping image is built by invoking a special
        utility inside a running &CCL; heap image to load files
        contained in the <literal>ccl/level-0</literal> directory. The
        bootstrapping image loads several dozen fasl files.  After
        it's done so, it saves a heap image via
        <literal>save-application</literal>. This process is called
        "cross-dumping".</para>

      <para>Given a source distribution, a lisp kernel, and a heap
        image, one can produce a bootstrapping image by first invoking
        &CCL; from the shell:</para>

shell&gt; ccl

      <para>This function compiles the lisp sources in the ccl/level-0
        directory if they're newer than the corresponding fasl files
        and then loads the resulting fasl files into a simulated lisp
        heap contained in data structures inside the running
        lisp. That simulated heap image is then written to
        disk.</para>
      <para><literal>xload-level-0</literal> should be called

        reader, the read-eval-print loop) is loaded, it's generally
        not possible for the lisp to report an error.  Errors that
        occur during these early stages ("the cold load") sometimes
        cause the lisp kernel debugger (see ) to be invoked; it's
        primitive, but can sometimes help one to get oriented.</para>
