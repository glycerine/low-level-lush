      <title>Heap space allocation</title>
      <para>Release 0.10 or later of &CCL; uses a different memory
      management scheme than previous versions did. Those earlier
      versions would allocate a block of memory (of specified size) at
      startup and would allocate lisp objects within that block. When
      that block filled with live (non-GCed) objects, the lisp would
      signal a "heap full" condition. The heap size imposed a limit on
      the size of the largest object that could be allocated.</para>
      <para>The new strategy involves reserving a very large (2GB on
      DarwinPPC32, 1GB on LinuxPPC, "very large" on 64-bit
      implementations) block at startup and consuming (and
      relinquishing) its contents as the size of the live lisp heap
      data grows and shrinks. After the initial heap image loads and
      after each full GC, the lisp kernel will try to ensure that a
      specified amount (the "lisp-heap-gc-threshold") of free memory
      is available. The initial value of this kernel variable is 16MB
      on 32-bit implementations and 32MB on 64-bit implementations ;
      it can be manipulated from Lisp (see below.)</para>
      <para>The large reserved memory block consumes very little in
      the way of system resources; memory that's actually committed to
      the lisp heap (live data and the "threshold" area where
      allocation takes place) consumes finite resources (physical
      memory and swap space). The lisp's consumption of those
      resources is proportional to its actual memory usage, which is
      generally a good thing.</para>
      <para>This scheme is much more flexible than the old one, but it
      may also increase the possibility that those resources can
      become exhausted.  Neither the new scheme nor the old handles
      that situation gracefully; under the old scheme, a program that
      consumes lots of memory may have run into an artificial limit on
      heap size before exhausting virtual memory.</para> 

      <para>The -R or &ndash;heap-reserve command-line option can be
      use to limit the size of the reserved block and therefore bound
      heap expansion. Running</para>
      <programlisting>
> openmcl --heap-reserve 8M
</programlisting>
      <para>would provide an execution environment that's very similar to
that provided by earlier &CCL; versions.</para>

    <sect1 id="The-Ephemeral-GC">
      <title>The Ephemeral GC</title>
      <para>For many programs, the following observations are true to
      a very large degree:</para>

      <orderedlist continuation="restarts" inheritnum="ignore">
	<listitem>
	  <para>Most heap-allocated objects have very short lifetimes ("are
	  ephemeral"): they become inaccessible soon after they're created.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Most non-ephemeral objects have very long lifetimes: it's
	  rarely productive for the GC to consider reclaiming them, since
	  it's rarely able to do so. (An object that has survived a large
	  number of GCs is likely to survive the next one. That's not always
	  true of course, but it's a reasonable heuristic.)</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>It's relatively rare for an old object to be destructively
	  modified (via SETF) so that it points to a new one, therefore most
	  references to newly-created objects can be found in the stacks and
	  registers of active threads. It's not generally necessary to scan
	  the entire heap to find references to new objects (or to prove that
	  such references don't exists), though it is necessary to keep
	  track of the (hopefully exceptional) cases where old objects are
	  modified to point at new ones.</para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>"Ephemeral" (or "generational") garbage collectors try to
      exploit these observations: by concentrating on frequently
      reclaiming newly-created objects quickly, it's less often
      necessary to do more expensive GCs of the entire heap in order
      to reclaim unreferenced memory.  In some environments, the
      pauses associated with such full GCs can be noticeable and
      disruptive, and minimizing the frequency (and sometimes the
      duration) of these pauses is probably the EGC's primary goal
      (though there may be other benefits, such as increased locality
      of reference and better paging behavior.) The EGC generally
      leads to slightly longer execution times (and slightly higher,
      amortized GC time), but there are cases where it can improve
      overall performance as well; the nature and degree of its impact
      on performance is highly application-dependent.</para>
      <para>Most EGC strategies (including the one employed by
      &CCL;) logically or physically divide memory into one or more
      areas of relatively young objects ("generations") and one or
      more areas of old objects.  Objects that have survived one or
      more GCs as members of a young generation are promoted (or
      "tenured") into an older generation, where they may or may not
      survive long enough to be promoted to the next generation and
      eventually may become "old" objects that can only be reclaimed
      if a full GC proves that there are no live references to them.
      This filtering process isn't perfect - a certain amount of
      premature tenuring may take place - but it usually works very
      well in practice.</para>
      <para>It's important to note that a GC of the youngest
      generation is typically very fast (perhaps a few milliseconds on
      a modern CPU, depending on various factors), &CCL;'s EGC is
      not concurrent and doesn't offer realtime guarantees.</para>
      <para>&CCL;'s EGC maintains three ephemeral generations; all
      newly created objects are created as members of the youngest
      generation. Each generation has an associated
      <emphasis>threshold</emphasis>, which indicates the number of
      bytes in it and all younger generations that can be allocated
      before a GC is triggered. These GCs will involve the target
      generation and all younger ones (and may therefore cause some
      premature tenuring); since the older generations have larger
      thresholds, they're GCed less frequently and most short-lived
      objects that make it into an older generation tend not to
      survive there very long.</para>
      <para>The EGC can be <emphasis>enabled</emphasis> or
      <emphasis>disabled</emphasis> under program control; under some
      circumstances, it may be enabled but
      <emphasis>inactive</emphasis> (because a full GC is imminent.)
      Since it may be hard to know or predict the consing behavior of
      other threads, the distinction between the "active" and
      "inactive" state isn't very meaningful, especially when native
      threads are involved.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="GC-Page-reclamation-policy">
      <title>GC Page reclamation policy</title>
      <para>After a full GC finishes, it'll try to ensure that at
      least (LISP-HEAP-GC-THRESHOLD) of virtual memory are available;
      objects will be allocated in this block of memory until it fills
      up, the GC is triggered, and the process repeats itself.</para>
      <para>Many programs reach near stasis in terms of the amount of
      logical memory that's in use after full GC (or run for long
      periods of time in a nearly static state), so the logical
      address range used for consing after the Nth full GC is likely
      to be nearly or entirely identical to the address range used by
      the N+1th full GC.</para>
      <para>By default (and traditionally in &CCL;), the GC's policy
      is to "release" the pages in this address range: to advise the
      virtual memory system that the pages contain garbage and any
      physical pages associated with them don't need to be swapped out
      to disk before being reused and to (re-)map the logical address
      range so that the pages will be zero-filled by the virtual
      memory system when they're next accessed.  This policy is
      intended to reduce the load on the VM system and keep &CCL;'s
      working set to a minimum.</para>
      <para>For some programs (especially those that cons at a very
      high rate), the default policy may be less than ideal: releasing
      pages that are going to be needed almost immediately - and
      zero-fill-faulting them back in, lazily - incurs unnecessary
      overhead. (There's a false economy associated with minimizing
      the size of the working set if it's just going to shoot back up
      again until the next GC.) A policy of "retaining" pages between
      GCs might work better in such an environment.</para>
      <para>Functions described below give the user some control over
      this behavior. An adaptive, feedback-mediated approach might
      yield a better solution.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 id="iPure--areas-are-read-only--paged-from-image-file">
      <title>"Pure" areas are read-only, paged from image file</title>
      <para>SAVE-APPLICATION identifies code vectors and the pnames of
      interned symbols and copies these objects to a "pure" area of
      the image file it creates. (The "pure" area accounts for most of
      what the ROOM function reports as "static" space.)</para>
      <para>When the resulting image file is loaded, the pure area of
      the file is now memory-mapped with read-only access. Code and
      pure data are paged in from the image file as needed (and don't
      compete for global virtual memory resources with other memory
      areas.)</para>
      <para>Code-vectors and interned symbol pnames are immutable : it
      is an error to try to change the contents of such an
      object. Previously, that error would have manifested itself in
      some random way. In the new scheme, it'll manifest itself as an
      "unhandled exception" error in the Lisp kernel. The kernel could
      probably be made to detect a spurious, accidental write to
      read-only space and signal a lisp error in that case, but it
      doesn't yet do so.</para>
      <para>The image file should be opened and/or mapped in some mode
      which disallows writing to the memory-mapped regions of the file
      from other processes. I'm not sure of how to do that; writing to
      the file when it's mapped by &CCL; can have unpredictable and
      unpleasant results.  SAVE-APPLICATION will delete its output
      file's directory entry and create a new file; one may need to
      exercise care when using file system utilities (like tar, for
      instance) that might overwrite an existing image file.</para>

    <sect1 id="Weak-References">
      <title>Weak References</title>
      <para>In general, a "weak reference" is a reference to an object
      which does not prevent the object from being garbage-collected.
      For example, suppose that you want to keep a list of all the
      objects of a certain type.  If you don't take special steps, the
      fact that you have a list of them will mean that the objects are
      always "live", because you can always reference them through the
      list.  Therefore, they will never be garbage-collected, and
      their memory will never be reclaimed, even if they are
      referenced nowhere else in the program.  If you don't want this
      behavior, you need weak references.</para>

      <para>&CCL; supports weak references with two kinds of objects:
      weak hash tables and populations.</para>

      <para>Weak hash tables are created with the standard Common Lisp
      function <literal>make-hash-table</literal>, which is extended
      to accept the keyword argument <literal>:weak</literal>.  Hash
      tables may be weak with respect to either their keys or their
      values.  To make a hash table with weak keys, invoke
      <literal>make-hash-table</literal> with the option :weak t, or,
      equivalently, :weak :key.  To make one with weak values, use
      :weak :value.  When the key is weak, the equality test must be
      #'eq (because it wouldn't make sense otherwise).</para>

      <para>When garbage-collection occurs, key-value pairs are
      removed from the hash table if there are no non-weak references to
      the weak element of the pair (key or value).</para>

      <para>In general, weak-key hash tables are useful when you want
      to use the hash to store some extra information about the
      objects you look up in it, while weak-value hash tables are
      useful when you want to use the hash as an index for looking up
      objects.</para>

      <para>A population encapsulates an object, causing certain
      reference from the object to be considered weak.  &CCL; supports
      two kinds of populations: lists, in which case the encapsulated
      object is a list of elements, which are spliced out of the list
      when there are no non-weak references to the element; and alists,
      in which case the encapsulated object is a list of conses which
      are spliced out of the list if there are no non-weak references
      to the car of the cons.</para>

    <para>If you are experimenting with weak references
      interactively, remember that an object is not dead if it was
      returned by one of the last three interactively-evaluated
      expressions, because of the variables <literal>*</literal>,
      <literal>**</literal>, and <literal>***</literal>.  The easy
      workaround is to evaluate some meaningless expression before
      invoking <literal>gc</literal>, to get the object out of the
      REPL variables.</para>

	  <para>Puts the indicated threshold sizes in effect.
          Each threshold indicates the total size that may be allocated
          in that and all younger generations before a GC is triggered.
          Disables EGC while setting the values.
	  (The provided threshold sizes are rounded up to a multiple of
	  64Kbytes in &CCL; 0.14 and to a multiple of 32KBytes in earlier
	  versions.)</para>
