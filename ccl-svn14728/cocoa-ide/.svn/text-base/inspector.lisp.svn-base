Implements inspector windows in Cocoa

This builds heavily on the inspector objects defined in ccl/lib/describe.lisp.

An inspector-item is an Objective-C object that contains a lisp-inspector, and a vector of child inspector-items
that are filled in lazily as required.

To Do:  
Make scroll bars work
Make command-left-arrow and command-right-arrow go back and forward
Add tabs
Set window title based on object
Add "Inspect" menu item (Key equivalent: command-I) - and make it work in many situations
  If an inspector is on top, inspect selection in place
  If an editor is on top
    If there is a selection, eval and inspect
    If no selection look for a nearby form to eval and inspect 
  If listener is on top and insertion point is after prompt, inspect *
  Inspect selection of other windows, backtrace, apropos, etc.

Make meta-dot edit source in many places, have menu item which is disabled when it doesn't make sense
Handle comments, and static inspector items
Make editing in place work in some situations
Make command-double-click bring up new inspector window
Make command-T inspect in a new tab
add bookmarks for commonly inspected objects - forms to evaluate
Add set-package widget to many places to effect printed representations and evaluation contexts
Make a way to get inspected object to listener, possibly set *
  (to be consistent with editor windows, make enter print it in listener setting *
    make command-enter, do that and bring listener to the front)
In some situations, remember and display form that was evaluated to get currently inspected object
When form is shown, refresh re-evaluates form
Possibly add splitter
Possibly add linked panes
Maybe get rid of contextual menus when main menu handles everything
Make preferences for fonts, key commands

The inspector-window-controller is specified in the nib file to be the data source for the NSTableView.
In order to be a data source it must implement the NSTableDataSource protocol.

The NSTableDataSource methods to get values for the NSTableView are:
- (NSInteger)numberOfRowsInTableView:(NSTableView *)aTableView
- (id)tableView:(NSTableView *)aTableView objectValueForTableColumn:(NSTableColumn *)aTableColumn row:(NSInteger)rowIndex

For simplicity, the latter method returns NSStrings (it could return other types that need special formatting objects)

If we want the table view to support other features such as setting, sorting, or drag and drop, other
NSTableDataSource methods can be defined.
