SPELL was originally part of Hemlock, CMUCL's Common Lisp text editor.
This version has been mostly rewritten in portable ANSI CL.  The only
file that remains to be converted is spell-aug.lisp.  Besides ripping
out implementation-specific code, the biggest change is that the spelling
dictionary is no longer a global variable.  Instead, it has been
converted to be a class; multiple dictionaries may thus coexist at any
one time.  Most functions have therefore been changed to take an extra
DICTIONARY parameter.

An ASDF system definition is contained in spell.asd.

Semi-extensive testing has been done.  However, a test suite would be
a good thing to write.

To get started, compile and load the system, then enter

(SPELL::BUILD-DICTIONARY #p"/path/to/spell-dictionary.text" "outfile")
(SETF MY-DICTIONARY *)
(CORRECT-SPELLING MY-DICTIONARY "debugg")

spellcoms.lisp is a file containing Hemlock commands and functions to
integrate the SPELL package into Hemlock.  It needs to be rewritten
to work with the new code, but is an example of what can be done with
the provided interfaces.
