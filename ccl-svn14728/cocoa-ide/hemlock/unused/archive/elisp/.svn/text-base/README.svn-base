This is currently a work-in-progess.

The aim is to build an environment taht lets most elisp packages run inside
PHemlock. Two things that explicitly will not be handled is "emacs sockets"
and "emacs sub-processes". There may be stubs for them, actuallym, there
will probably be stubs for them.

Currently, most of the code is horribly uncommented and there's next-to-no
docstrings. This will be fixed, at some point.

The current files in the implementation, with a description of my
generals thoughts of what should go where:

base.lisp: This is the "base elisp" implementation. Things here end up
           in the ELISP package and should in general be "user visible".

codewalker.lisp: This is a code walker necessary to wrap "variable
           access". It's not the most well-tested piece of code in the
           world, but so far it hasn't fallen over on my test cases.

hemlock-shims.lisp: This is functions that need to interact deeply
                    with Hemlock (key definitions etc, etc).

internals.lisp: This is the file for what ends up being needed but not
                fitting anywhere else.

loadup.lisp: Load all files, in something approaching a sensible order.

packages.lisp: Package definitions.

read-table.lisp: Readtables and support functions.

implementation-needed: Contains a tentative list of symbols in GNU
    Emacs that may or may not need sensible implementation before
    we're done. Theory is, once all built-ins are in place, we can
    then bootstrap off whatever files tag along with emacs, should
    anyone want to.

Here are some things to look at before releasing:
