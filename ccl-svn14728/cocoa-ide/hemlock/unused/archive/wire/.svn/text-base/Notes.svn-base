Wire was using its own buffer management -- how useful. We did away
with that an read/write directly from an binary stream for now.

TODO

- actually switch to binary streams
- invent something for strings (say define it as unicode or something)

- can we do a reasonable attempt to make symbol lookup work across
  lisp implementations?

- can we make this at least somewhat work with CLISP?

- conditions.

- Do away with superfluous large macros

- Can we again do with a serve event kind of interface for poor Lisp
  which do not feature multiprocessing (like say CLISP)?
