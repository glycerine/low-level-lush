    <h1 align=center>Portable Hemlock</h1>
<p>
Hemlock is an Emacs-like editor which for a long time was a part of <a
href='http://www.cons.org/cmucl/'>CMUCL</a>. It was believed that it
is tied to this particular implementation of Common Lisp. But this is
no longer true.

<p>
So, here is Portable Hemlock! An attempt to free Hemlock from its CMUCL
prison.

<p>
The stuff that works is opening files, editing them and saving your
work -- what you expect from an editor. Lisp mode works too. Missing
is: tty mode operation, typescript buffers (inferior shell and
inferior lisp), spell checking, netnews and mail.
<p>
Portable Hemlock was tested in:
<ul>
<li> <a href='http://www.cons.org/cmucl/'>CMUCL</a>
<li> <a href='http://clisp.cons.org/'>CLISP</a>
<li> <a href='http://openmcl.clozure.com/'>OpenMCL</a> (patches not yet received)
<li> <a href='http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/'>SBCL</a>, patches by Daniel Barlow.
<li> <a href='http://www.scieneer.com/scl/'>Scieneer Common Lisp</a>, patches by Douglas Crosher.
</ul>

<h2>Download</h2>

<h2>News/History</h2>

<dl>
<dt>2003-08-05
<dd>I was a bit lazy updating the web page. Here is what happend:
<ul>

<li>Ingvar Mattsson is hacking an elisp compatibility package.

<li>I am currently working on providing the "Slave Lisp"
functionality, so that Portable Hemlock will be useful for actually
hacking Lisp code.

</ul>

<dt>2003-03-06
<dd>Bug fix: <tt>auto-save.lisp</tt> was not compiling.
<dt>2003-03-05
<dd>This web page was created.<p>
    New release having the SBCL patches in.
<dt>2003-02-07
<dd>Portable Hemlock was announced to <a href='http://www.cliki.net/IRC'>#lisp</a>.
<dt>2002-11-??
<dd>I made initial attempt to port Hemlock from CMUCL. Then put it aside to work on other stuff.
</dl>

<h2>Random Notes</h2>

<p>
The source code of Hemlock showed unportability (or better its age) in
the following areas:
<ul>
<li><P>
   Buffers sometimes also serve as streams. As Hemlock was written
   there was no universal de-facto standard interface for user defined
   streams and thus the authors defined CMUCL streams. These days we
   have Gray streams.

<li><p>
   File I/O was tied to both CMUCL and Unix to accommodate probably
   slow machines. The file I/O functions called
   <tt>unix-read</tt> and <tt>unix-write</tt> beaming data directly to
   and fro system areas. I changed that using standard CL functions
   doing I/O on a line-by-line basis now.

<li><p>
   The TTY interface is inherently unportable. Currently it is
   disabled altogether. I think we could reclaim some useful code from
   Hemlock's TTY interface and morph it into a CLIM TTY port. And
   since my graphics card cannot even display a text console interface
   on my monitor, this has very low priority on my list, though other
   people might want to have it.

<li><p>
   The X11 interface uses the <tt>SERVE-EVENT</tt> facility of CMUCL,
   which naturally is only available there. I provided a thin
   portability layer to provide the same API using just the standard
   CLX interface.
</ul>
<p>
This already summaries pretty well the current state of Portable
Hemlock. You can edit files using the X11 interface on an ANSI CL
which provides for CLX.

<h2>Future</h2>

<p>
The next steps I have in mind are:

<ul>
<li> <p>Port the missing files except the TTY interface.

<li> <p>Hemlock has the idea that characters are 8-bit wide. We need to
   teach it otherwise as we have Unicode strings now. This involves
   syntax tables and probably searching.

<li> <P>I want a CLIM Hemlock.
<p>
   How exactly to do this is still not decided. I see two
   possibilities:
<ul>
<li> Hemlock already provides for a kind of device interface. We can
     implement a new device which is just a CLIM device.

<li> Or we rip this device abstraction layer and state that CLIM
     itself is the device layer. (Making the bet that we'll have a TTY
     CLIM in the future).
</ul>
</ul>
<p>After that is done, we can talk about extending Portable Hemlock in various
ways like syntax highlighting, color, new modes, ... you name it.
