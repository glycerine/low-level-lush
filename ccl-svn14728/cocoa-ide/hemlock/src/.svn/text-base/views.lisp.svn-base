;;
;; A HEMLOCK-VIEW represents text displayed in a (pane inside a) window.
;; Conceptually it consists of a text buffer, a modeline for semi-permanent status
;; info, an echo area for transient status info, and a text input area for reading
;; prompted input.  Currently the last two are conflated.
;;
;; A HEMLOCK-VIEW never changes which text buffer it displays (unlike in emacs).  A
;; text buffer can be displayed in multiple HEMLOCK-VIEW's, although currently there
;; is no UI to make that happen.  But we try take care to distinguish per-buffer info
;; from per-view info.  The former is stored in the buffer struct and in buffer
;; variables.  The latter is currently stored in HEMLOCK-VIEW slots, although I'd
;; like to introduce user-definable "view variables" and get rid of some of these
;; user-level slots.  [Note: currently, multiple views on a buffer are but a remote
;; dream.  Basic things like the insertion point are still per buffer when they
;; should be per view]
;;
;; The user interacts with a HEMLOCK-VIEW using events.  Each time the user presses a
;; key, the OS arranges to invoke our event handler.  The event handler computes and
;; invokes a hemlock command bound to the key.  The command is invoked in a
;; dynamic context most suitable for modifying the text buffer associated with the
;; HEMLOCK-VIEW, but by jumping through a few hoops, it can modify other buffers.
