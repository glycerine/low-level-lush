;;;; Key Tables:
;;;
;;;    A key table provides a way to translate a sequence of characters to some
;;; lisp object.  It is currently represented by a tree of hash-tables, where
;;; each level is a hashing from a key to either another hash-table or a value.


;;; GET-TABLE-ENTRY returns the value at the end of a series of hashings.  For
;;; our purposes it is presently used to look up commands and key-translations.
;;;

      (let ((key-event (aref key i)))
	(setf foo (gethash key-event table))
	(unless (hash-table-p foo) (return foo))
	(setf table foo)))))

;;; SET-TABLE-ENTRY sets the entry for key in table to val, creating new
;;; tables as needed.  If val is nil, then use REMHASH to remove this element
;;; from the hash-table.

;;;; Key Translation:

;;; untranslated and return the second value true.
